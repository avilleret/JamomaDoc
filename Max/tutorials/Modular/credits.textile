h3. Overview

This is an overview of the contributions made to the Jamoma project. This list is not fully comprehensive.

For instance, it cannot reflect the extensive discussion and dialog of the entire group that contributes much to the development of Jamoma - not to mention our tinkering with each other's code!

h3. Third Party Software

Other open-source packages that we are using within Jamoma:

h4. TTBlue

Tap.Tools Blue is the open source dsp library by Tim Place that is underlying both Tap.Tools Max (available from Electrotap) and Jamoma. It has been renamed as JamomaDSP.

h4. ICST Ambisonics Library for Max

The ICST Ambisonics Tools are a set of externals for Max/MSP for audio spatialisation and source placement control by Jan Schacher (Jasch) and Philippe Kocher.

h4. PCRE

C Library for using regular expressions in the jmod.oscroute external to match wildcards and patterns.

h3. More Due Credits

Not to forget...

The OSC implementation of namespace for the "VST module":modules/jmod.vst~.html is based on "ideas":http://opensoundcontrol.org/VST suggested by M. Zbyszynski and A. Freed: "Control of VST Plug-ins using OSC":http://archive.cnmat.berkeley.edu/ICMC2005/ICMC_mzed6.html. Proceedings of the ICMC 2005. The interface for the module was partly inspired by the brilliant "Radial":http://cycling74.com/downloads/discontinued/ application.
