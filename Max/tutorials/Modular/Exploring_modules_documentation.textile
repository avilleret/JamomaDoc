h3. Documentation of the module

Some complex modules can contain many parameters, which make its "namespace":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace_%28computer_science%29 complex and hard to remember. Thanks to Jamoma consistent architecture and GUI, there are some tools to help you with that.

h3. Pop-up namespace reminder

If you click and hold the mouse over the displayed name of the module almost all the way to the left in the module toolbar, a pop-up menu shows up, listing all parameters, messages and returns of this particular module.

h3. HTML reference page

If you click further left onto the grey button with the triangle, you will bring up another pop-up menu. In the previous tutorial we used this to peek inside the module, by choosing the  %(samp)View Internal Components% menu item. Now it is time to try a few other options that documents the module.

If you select  %(samp)Open Reference Page% a web page will show up in your default web browser, such as this "reference page for jmod.tremolo~":modules/jmod.tremolo~.html.

This will provide you with a detailed list of all parameters, messages and returns, a description explaining what the parameter does, and additional information on how it behaves, e.g:

* What type of data is expected (decimal, integer, etc.).
* The default range of the parameter.
* Whether it is clipping or not at the boundaries of the default range.
* The default function used for ramping.
* The default mechanism used to drive the ramping.
* What dataspace the parameter use, if any.
* Whether or not repeted values will be filtered out.

Some of this will make more sense as we move further.

h3. Help files for modules

Finally, if you select %(samp)Open Help Patch% from the pop-up menu, a help patch opens up, where you can interactively examine the module. The help file also contains links to the HTML reference page, and offers simple ways of viewing what issues or bugs (if any) are currently registered for the module.
