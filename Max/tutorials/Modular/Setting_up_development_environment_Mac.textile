Before downloading Jamoma sources and compile them a few steps are required to properly setting up your development environment.

Install Apple's "Xcode":https://developer.apple.com/resources/ tools (you will need an Apple ID).

bq.  The current version is 4, but we recommend using 3.X until more testing has been done.

If you don't have it, you can download it from developer.apple.com. It is roughly 4GB of downloading and requires a free login.

When done, go to your application folder and select Max application.
Then, show the package contents (ctrl-click on the application) of Max, go to Contents/Frameworks and copy the four framework folders to /Library/Frameworks

Read the readme.txt in the root folder of the Jamoma project for further instructions.
