brief: Distance amplitude panning

desc: >
 DBAP is a amplitude based spatialisation technique that can be used with irregular loudspeakers configuation. It does not assume the loudspeakers to be in a regular array or circle surrounding the listener, and neither is it optimized for a particular listening position (sweet spot).

input:
 - name: 1
   desc: Input used to set sources and positions.

output:
 - name: 1
   desc: 'Matrix~-formatted messages (source id number, speaker id number, gain).'
 - name: 2
   desc: Output distance from convex hull.
 - name: 3
   desc: 'Output lists of x, y and cell value to be used with jit.matrix display.'
 - name: 4
   desc: Dump out jcom.dbap setup info.

attributes:
 - name: dimensions
   type: integer
   desc: 'Number of dimensions of the geometric space: 1, 2 or 3.'
   unit:
   default: 2
 - name: num_sources
   type: integer
   desc: Number of sources to be panned
   unit:
   default: 1
 - name: num_destinations
   type: integer
   desc: Number of destination points the incoming signals will be panned to.
   unit:
   default: 1
 - name: rolloff
   type: decimal
   desc: 'The relative roll-off of amplitude with increasing distance from a destination point. The higher the roll-off value, the more sources will tend to be attracted towards the closest destination(s). High values can be used for synthetic spatialisation effects where sources are attracted to one destination at a time, with non-discontinuous transitions from one destination to the next.'
   unit: dB
   default: 6

messages:
 - name: blur
   type: 'array (instance, blur)'
   desc: "The spatial blurriness of each source can be controlled by the message @blur@ with two arguments: the source instance number (integer), starting at 1, and the blur factor to use (decimal). The blur factor is related to the size of the space spanned by the destination points, with the intent that it is supposed to perceptually work similarly when moved from one layout to another. <br/> When the distance from source to destination is calculated as part of the DBAP algorithm, a radius _r_ is introduced as an extra dimension in the calculation: distance = sqrt(Δx*Δx+Δy*Δy+r*r) where r = blur*v <br/> v is the variance of mean distance from destination points to the the mean position of the destination space. The larger the blurriness is, the more evenly the signal is distributed to all positions, resulting in a more diffuse localization."
   unit: factor
   default: _n_ 0
 - name: blurall
   type: decimal
   desc: The @blurall@ message with a decimal argument can be used to set @blur@ factor for all sources.
   unit: factor
   default: 0
 - name: dst_position
   type: 'array (integer, decimal)'
   desc: "The message @dst_position@ can be used to set the position of one destination point. An integer argument sets the instance number, starting from 1, and is followed by one to three decimal values setting the position, according to the current number of dimensions."
   unit:
   default:
 - name: info
   type: string
   desc: The message @info@ cause jcom.dbap to output information concerning current positions of sources and destinations.
   unit:
   default:
 - name: master_gain
   type: decimal
   desc: The message @master_gain@ can be used to control the general gain level for all matrix~ routings controlled by jcom.dbap. All amplitude values calculated internally by jcom.dbap are multiplied by the value of @master_gain@ before being passed to matrix~.
   unit: linear
   default: 1.
 - name: src_gain
   type: 'array (integer, decimal)'
   desc: "The message @src_gain@ can be used to control incoming gain level independently for each source. An integer argument sets the instance number, starting from 1, and is followed by a decimal value interpreted as linear gain level. All source gain levels are set to 1.0 on initialization of the object."
   unit: linear
   default: 1.
 - name: src_mute
   type: array (integer integer)
   desc: "The message @src_mute@ can be used to individually mute and unmute the sources. An integer argument sets the instance number, starting from 1, and is followed by a integer or decimal value. A value of 0 or 0.0 un-mutes the source, all other values mutes the source."
   unit:
   default: _n_ 0
 - name: src_position
   type: array
   desc: "The message @src_position@ can be used to set the position of one source point. An integer argument sets the instance number, starting from 1, and is followed by one to three decimal values setting the position, according to the current number of dimensions."
