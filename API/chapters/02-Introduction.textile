The Jamoma Platform is composed of a layered framework architecture that creates an object model and then specializes that object model for advanced purposes such as audio and graphics.

* Foundation : Runtime and API implementing a light-weight, dynamically bound, reflective object-oriented architecture layer on top of C++
* DSP : A C++ framework for audio processing objects
* Graph : A coding layer for the creation of dynamic asynchronous graph topographies
* Audio Graph : A coding layer for the creation of dynamic audio graph topographies
* Graphics : A Cairo-based graphics system build on the Jamoma Foundation API
* Modular : A modular framework for patching in Max
* Ruby : Jamoma Ruby - Language Bindings for the Jamoma Platform
* Test : Automated unit test system for Jamoma
* Tools : Tools and Utilities for the Development and Distribution of Jamoma
