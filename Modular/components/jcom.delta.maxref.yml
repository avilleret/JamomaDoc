brief: "Calculate difference, second order difference and velocity of incoming data stream."

desc: >
 jcom.delta calculates difference, second order difference and velocity of incoming data stream.

inputs:
 - name: 1
   desc: Input data stream to be filtered.

outputs:
 - name: 1
   desc: "1st order difference. Δx = x[n]-x[n-1]"
 - name: 2
   desc: "2d order difference. Δ^2(x) = x[n]-2*x[n-1]+x[n-2]"
 - name: 3
   desc: Velocity calculated from incoming stream of data as difference divided by delta time in milliseconds: velocity = 1000*Δx/Δt
 - name: 4
   desc: Dumpout

messages:
 - name: bang
   type: generic
   desc: "A 'bang' sent at the input calculates and outputs difference, second order difference and velocity using currently stored values."
   unit:
   default:
 - name: int
   type: integer
   desc: An integer sent at the input is converted to decimal value.
   unit:
   default:
 - name: float
   type: decimal
   desc: "A decimal sent at the input is stored as the most recent value x[n] , and difference, second order difference and velocity is calculated and output."
   unit:
   default:
 - name: clear
   type: string
   desc: "The message 'clear' sent at the input clears the history of previously received values. Next time a value is received, x[n-1] and x[n-2] are set equal to x[n]."
   unit:
   default:
 - name: set
   type: decimal (set float)
   desc: "The message 'set' followed by a decimal sent at the input stores its value as the most recent (x[n]) without performing any calculation or producing any output."
   unit:
   default:
