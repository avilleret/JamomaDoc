h3. Hosting Jamoma modules at Github




So you developed some fabulous modules that you would like to put under "Git":http://git-scm.com/ "version control":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control, whether it is to keep history of all changes you made, to have a backup of your files or just because you feel it is fun. Here for the sake of the example, we will look into hosting your sources to "Github":http://www.github.com where all Jamoma source reside. However, following these steps will also gets you to the tracks for hosting your work at other hosting site or on your personnal server.

h4(LessonTitle). <span class="StepNumber">1</span>Create a repository at Github

Once logged in to Github with your personnal account, go to the @"Dashboard":https://github.com/dashboard/yours@ page %(seq)1% and click the @"New Repository":http://github.com/repositories/new@ button %(seq)2%.



Now you need to set up  the name of your project %(seq)1%, a short description %(seq)2% and optionally a url %(seq)3% leading to your site. All these informations will be displayed on your project page. When all fields are completed, click the @Create Repository@.

When done, Github should get you to your project page. From here, copy your project Git url (i.e @git@github.com:username/yourProject.git@) that you will use to clone the project on your  computer.

h4(LessonTitle). <span class="StepNumber">2</span>Put your project under Git control

If you have not yet done so, create a folder on your computer where you want to store your project. Here we create a folder named @myUserLib@ on the Desktop.




!(lightbox)images/media_1286564424750.png!


Open Terminal.app (which resides in Applications/Utilities/, under OSX), then from the command line, type the following to go to that folder :
@cd /path/to/myUserLib@ (where "/path/to/myUserLib" is the path leading to the folder where you created your project).[1] 

fn1. If you are not comfortable with the command line, note that under OSX, you can type @cd @ and drag the folder on the Terminal window.

Now you need to set your project folder as a Git local repository. To do so, type @git init@.

Switch to the Finder or File Explorer and drag and copy your project files in your Git repository. Here, we copy the folder @myFabulousModule@ and its contained files (Max patch, .html documentation and .xml preset file).

Although we copied our files into the folder, we need to specify Git to "add":http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-add.html these files under revision control. We do this be running the @git add@ command. The @--all@ option as shown in the illustration below, allows to add all files contained in the @UserLib@ folder.

Now we can store the current content in a new "commit":http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-commit.html, using the command @git commit@. We will also add a log message using the @-m@ option follow by a message under quotes to describe the changes.

We now need to add a "remote":http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-remote.html for the repository at Github. Run the following command to do so:

@git remote add origin git@github:username/yourProject.git@
!(lightbox)images/media_1286564475848.png!


Finally, we can now "update":http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-push.html the remote repository with the changes:

@git push origin HEAD@
